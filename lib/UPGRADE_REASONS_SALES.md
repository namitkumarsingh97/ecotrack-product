## Sales Conversation Templates

### When Prospect Asks About Multi-Year Trends
**Response**: "Multi-year trends help you answer investor & client ESG questions faster. Without trend analysis, you may struggle to demonstrate ESG progress to stakeholders. This feature shows continuous improvement and builds trust with enterprise clients."

### When Prospect Asks About API Access
**Response**: "API access automates data collection and integrates with your existing systems. Manual data entry increases errors and delays reporting cycles. You'll save 10+ hours per month with automated data sync and integrations."

### When Prospect Asks About Benchmarking
**Response**: "Benchmarking helps you understand where you stand vs competitors. Without benchmarking, you can't identify improvement opportunities or competitive gaps. This positions your company as an ESG leader in your industry."

### When Prospect Asks About Custom Branding
**Response**: "Branded reports strengthen your company's professional image with clients. Unbranded reports look unprofessional and reduce client confidence. Present ESG data in a way that matches your brand identity."

### When Prospect Asks About White-Label
**Response**: "White-labeling lets you present ESG data under your own brand to clients. Without white-labeling, you can't offer ESG services as your own product. This enables you to monetize ESG reporting as a value-added service to your clients."

## Objection Handling

### "We don't need advanced features"
**Response**: "I understand. However, [feature] is [why it matters]. Without it, [risk avoided]. With it, [value unlocked]."

### "The price is too high"
**Response**: "Let's focus on ROI. [Feature] helps you [business impact]. The cost of not having it is [risk avoided]. The value you unlock is [value unlocked]."

### "We'll upgrade later"
**Response**: "That's a valid approach. However, [feature] is [why it matters]. Waiting means [risk avoided]. Starting now means [value unlocked]."
